* Understanding the code structure

This code is divided into the following source code files:
- main.c
- matrix.c
- util.c
- rref.c
- nullspace.c

The header files are:
- matrix.h
- util.h

Additional files are:
- LICENSE
- makefile

** To build the code and run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make
./main.out
#+END_SRC

** Program flow
The main contents of each file are as follows:
   - Contains the main driver code
   - The main function first asks the user to input the dimensions and the matrices A and b.
   - The main function then calls the /solve/ function defined in *rref.c* which returns a structure /aug mat/ which is defined in *matrix.h* which returns the Reduced Row Echelon Form of matrix A and values of the pivots.
   - Then we calculate the nullspace of the matrix by using the results returned in the above step. This is done by the nullspace function defined under *nullspace.c*.
   - We can use these results to determine the nature of the solution by using the solution function defined in *rref.c*.

** Sample Input and Output
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
Enter A:
a(11) a(12) ... a(1n)
.....................
a(n1) a(n2) ... a(nn)
Enter row and column seperated by space (E.g. 3 3): 3 4
Enter elements of a particular row in the same row itself or the program may exit
with Segmentation Fault
1 2 2 2
2 4 6 8
3 6 8 10


Enter b:
For solving a system of linear equations,
Enter the number of columns of b should be 1
b(11) b(12) ... b(1n)
.....................
b(n1) b(n2) ... b(nn)
Enter row and column seperated by space (E.g. 3 3): 3 1
Enter elements of a particular row in the same row itself or the program may exit
with Segmentation Fault

The pivots are:
	0	2

	1.00	2.00	0.00	-2.00	|	11.00
	0.00	0.00	1.00	2.00	|	-3.00
	0.00	0.00	0.00	0.00	|	-6.00



Nullspace of the equation is:
	-2.00	2.00
	1.00	0.00
	-0.00	-2.00
	0.00	1.00

Ax = b has No Solution
